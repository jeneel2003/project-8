**Udemy Data Analysis**

In this project, I analyze a Udemy Courses dataset using Python to gain insights into course offerings, pricing, popularity, and trends. The project covers essential data analysis techniques including data import, filtering, grouping, sorting, and more, using libraries like Pandas. Key questions such as identifying top-selling courses, free/paid courses, and trends in subject popularity are addressed.

Python functions used:
- `pd.read_csv` for data loading
- `groupby()` for aggregation
- `sort_values()` for sorting
- `unique()` and more for filtering and exploration

This project is beginner-friendly and ideal for those starting with Python data analysis.
